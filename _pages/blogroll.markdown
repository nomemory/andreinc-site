[In 2023]({{site.url}}/2023/03/10/social-media-quit), I boldly decided to quit (or reduce) the time lost on various Social Media Sites. 

As a natural consequence, I decided to create *my own social media feed* by traveling back to the 2000s, installing an RSS Reader (called unimaginatively [Feeder](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/)), and curating a list of blogs that I found interesting. I've become my own algorithm.

I usually find blogs I like by scrolling the top page of [hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/). Unfortunately, there's no other way. Searching for quality blogs online is almost impossible. 

~~They never pop up on the first page of any search engine~~.

A good source of finding good information is now [https://www.marginalia.nu/](https://www.marginalia.nu/). The [Website Explorer](https://explore.marginalia.nu/view) is an excellent way of accessing *the alternative indie internet*.

Another interesting source is [https://bukmark.club/](https://bukmark.club/).

And there is the [hackernews blogroll](https://dm.hn/).

If you have a personal blog, I recommend you create your *blogroll* section. Your readers will appreciate it. Accessing quality content has become challenging in recent years. Publishing a list of sites you truly like & follow & subscribe to is helpful for everyone.

You can email me if you know of similar blogs (see [/about/]({{site.url}}/about) for my address).

I can't entirely agree with everything the following people are writing.
