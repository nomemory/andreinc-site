I like to keep the content I read curated. 

Infinitely scrolling a social media wall is not something that I find satisfactory anymore ([https://lobste.rs/](https://lobste.rs/) is one of the few exceptions). In this regard, I returned to the good old habit of using RSS feeds. In this section, I keep the list of blogs (or notable articles) that I find/found interesting. 

I am sure many others are waiting to be discovered (by me), so this page should get updates as time flies.

<sub>As a personal preference, I usually don't read articles on blogs "powered by" *medium* or *substack*.</sub>

## Blogs I keep an eye on (alphabetical order)

* [abyteofcoding.com](https://abyteofcoding.com/issues/) - this is not exactly a blog but rather a newsletter that tracks and reviews geeky articles trending around the tech web.

* [attractivechaos.wordpress.com/](https://attractivechaos.wordpress.com/) - this is an [anonymous blog](https://attractivechaos.wordpress.com/about/). I am unsure if the (unknown) author plans to maintain it further, but here is where some particular questions of mine [found the answers](https://attractivechaos.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/deletion-from-hash-tables-without-tombstones/). 

* [begriffs.com/](https://begriffs.com/) - this is the personal blog of [Joe Nelson](https://github.com/begriffs): cool projects, [anecdotes](https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-11-15-c-portability.html), [parsing and lexing](https://begriffs.com/posts/2021-11-28-practical-parsing.html), postgres, [postgrest](https://begriffs.com/posts/2015-10-02-postgrest-workshop.html), and much more! 

* [benhoyt.com](https://benhoyt.com/writings/) - this is the personal site of Ben Hoyt. The articles about [GoAWK](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk) are some of my favorites (I don't even know how to write code in go!). 

* [dlvhdr.me](https://dlvhdr.me/) - this is the personal blog of [Dolev Hadar](https://github.com/dlvhdr). I discovered the blog only recently, but ["The Renaissance of the Command Line"](https://dlvhdr.me/posts/the-renaissance-of-the-command-line), is one of my 2022 favorite articles. 

* [drewdevault.com/](https://drewdevault.com/) - this is the personal blog of Drew DeVault: open source, [the hare programming language](https://harelang.org/), [unpopular opinions](https://drewdevault.com/2022/10/03/Does-Rust-belong-in-Linux.html) and [a good sense of humor](https://drewdevault.com/2021/11/16/Cash-for-leftpad.html). 

* [j3s.sh](https://j3s.sh) - this is the (*minismalist*) good-looking personal site of Jes Olson. Talks about Free Software and other tech topics. [Here](https://j3s.sh/thought/my-website-is-one-binary.html) is where I found the motivation for writing [this]({{site.url}}/2022/04/10/a-blog-that-is-a-single-executable-binary).

* [jse.li/](https://blog.jse.li/) - this is the personal blog of [Jesse Li](https://github.com/veggiedefender): interesting and diverse articles, bonus points: [humor](https://blog.jse.li/posts/ten-seconds/). 

* [lemire.me](https://lemire.me/blog/) - this is the blog of Daniel Lemire, a science professor at the University of Quebec. His articles always bring something unexpected to the table. For example, when was the last time you wondered: [How quickly you can convert floats to doubles and back?](https://lemire.me/blog/2022/07/20/how-quickly-can-you-convert-floats-to-doubles-and-back/). 

* [lowleveljavascript](https://www.youtube.com/c/lowleveljavascript) - this is the YouTube channel of [Francis Stokes](https://github.com/francisrstokes). Emulators, low-level stuff, javascript, it all makes sense now!

* [muscar.eu](https://muscar.eu/) - this is the blog of Alex Muscar, an *old* childhood friend. He writes about algorithms and CS topics.

* [nullprogram.com](https://nullprogram.com/) - this is the personal blog of Chris Wellons. His articles are always a source of inspiration (check [this](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/12/23/) out). Bonus: his [GitHub account](https://github.com/skeeto) is full of gems!

* [ptomato.wordpress.com/](https://ptomato.wordpress.com/) - this is the personal blog of "Philip Chimento": well-articulated and well-documented coding adventures. 

* [randomascii.wordpress.com](https://randomascii.wordpress.com) - this is the blog of Bruce Dawson: bugs, optimizations and technical anecdotes. 

* [smalldatum.blogspot.com/](https://smalldatum.blogspot.com/) - this is the personal blog of Mark Callaghan. This a *niche* blog that focuses on databases, storage engines, and the like. 

* [wellquite.org](https://wellquite.org/) - this is the personal blog of Matthew Sackman. I found the series [Let's build! A distributed, concurrent editor](https://wellquite.org/posts/lets_build/edist_intro/) extremely entertaining. 

* [xeiaso.net](https://xeiaso.net/blog) - this is the personal site of Xe Iaso. The articles here have a high level of geekiness and [humor](https://xeiaso.net/blog/sleeping-the-technical-interview).
