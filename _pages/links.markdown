This place is my *garden of curiosities*, or *a chocolate factory*, or *artifacts from an alternative Internet that never quite happened*. 

This section is a work in progress, and if the number of links increases, I will need to find a better solution to manage them.

# A.I.
* [Better without A.I.](https://betterwithout.ai/)
    * Better without AI explores moderate apocalypses that could result from current and near-future AI technology.

Rather: realistically likely disasters, up to the scale of our history’s worst wars and oppressions.
