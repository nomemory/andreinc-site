This place is my *garden of curiosities*, or *a chocolate factory*, or *artifacts from an alternative Internet that never quite happened*. 

This section is a work in progress, and if the number of links increases, I will need to find a better solution to manage them.

# A.I.
* [Better without A.I.](https://betterwithout.ai/)
    * Better without AI explores moderate apocalypses that could result from current and near-future AI technology. These are relatively overlooked risks: not extreme sci-fi extinction scenarios, nor the media’s obsession with “ChatGPT said something naughty” trivia. Rather: realistically likely disasters, up to the scale of our history’s worst wars and oppressions.
* [Bubble trouble (2024)](https://www.wheresyoured.at/bubble-trouble/)
    * A story about how A.I. companies are running out of quality training data.

    * Following the release of MDN’s AI chatbot “feature”, many developers turned to GitHub Issues to voice concerns. Most concerns revolved around the chatbot spouting misinformation on a technical reference expected to contain accurate information, and ethical concerns related to OpenAI and the use of a large language model (LLM).
* [Not By AI](https://notbyai.fyi/)
    * Banners to tell people what they read was not made with LLMs.

# Algorithms and Data Structures
* [A gentle introduction to Algorithm Complexity Analysis](http://discrete.gr/complexity/)
