#### `About`

<sup><sup><sup>Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, 2019</sup></sup></sup>

My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu; I live in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania). I am happily married and the father of ~~a~~ two sweet baby girls.

I have a *Bachelor's Degree in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology* from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest (2009).

I've started programming as a kid, in BASIC. My first <sup>micro</sup>computer was one [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/). All the lucky Romanian kids from 90s had them:

I haven't programmed professionally since 2017, but when I do, I consider myself primarily a Java or Kotlin guy, with a soft spot for C. I can also *speak* python and have basic conversations in C++ (although the natives accuse me of having a thick foreign accent). 

I keep my technical skills sharp by doing coding exercises, contributing to open-source software, and reinventing the wheel. My most *popular* project is [www.mockneat.com](http://www.mockneat.com). 

Outside of programming (and science subjects), I always had a great interest in music, chess and travelling. Unfortunately I cannot play any musical instrument, I am a [patzer](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patzer), and I haven't travelled much in recent years. The later might change in the future, but I am not so sure about the other two.

Romanian is my native language, and I am also fluent in English and French.

#### `The blog`

I usually blog about my interests: [C]({{site.url}}/categories/#c)/[Java]({{site.url}}/categories/#java)/[Kotlin]({{site.url}}/categories/#kotlin), Mathematics, Computer Science curricula (algorithms and data structures). Rarely I touch other subjects. 

The blog source code/content is hosted on [github/nomemory/andreinc-site](https://github.com/nomemory/andreinc-site). The code in the articles is not always tested (as it should). If you see any issues with it, please open a PR, and I will make sure I will merge it. 

The [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) for this blog is available [here]({{site.url}}/feed.xml). 

#### `Tools`

The blog is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The comments system is based on [utterances](https://utteranc.es/).

I create the "visuals" with [draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/). 

I use [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for math formulas.

#### `Contact & Collaboration` 

`gnomemory` (with an `@yahoo.com` or `@pm.me` endings). 

You can also find me on Discord (`nomemory#3352`), if you want to directly contact me. Communities where I usually hangout:
