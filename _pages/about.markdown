#### `About`

My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu.

<sup><sup><sup>Myself, Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, 2019</sup></sup></sup>

I was born in [Southern Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oltenia) in 1987, two years before the fall of communism.

I currently live in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania).

I am happily married and the father of ~~a~~ two sweet baby girls. 

I have a bachelor's degree in *Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information* technology from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest (2009).

I played with computers, programming languages, and technology since childhood. My first <sup>micro</sup>computer was one [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/). All the lucky Romanian kids from 90s had them:

My skills list includes C Programming, Java, python, and JavaScript. I have also flirted with C++, Kotlin, golang, and, to a lesser extent, Haskell and Scala. I am also somewhat proficient in math, at least in certain areas.

Romanian is my native language, and I am fluent in English and French.

#### `The blog`

I usually blog about my interests: programming and math.

Everything is hosted on [github/nomemory/andreinc-site](https://github.com/nomemory/andreinc-site). The code in the articles is not always tested (as it should). If you see any issues with it, please open a PR, and I will make sure I will merge it. 

The [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) for this blog is available [here]({{site.url}}/feed.xml). 

#### `Tools`

The blog is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The comments system is based on [utterances](https://utteranc.es/).

I create the "visuals" with [draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/). 

I use [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for math formulas.

For HTML Canvas-related stuff, I am using [p5js](https://p5js.org/).

#### `Contact & Collaboration` 

I will be flattered to receive your email: `gnomemory` (with an `@yahoo.com` or `@pm.me` endings).
