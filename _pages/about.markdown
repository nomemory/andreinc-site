#### `About`

My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu. 

![jpg]({{site.url}}/assets/images/about/me-it.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}
<sup><sup><sup>Myself, Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, 2019</sup></sup></sup>

I was born in [Southern Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oltenia), [Bailesti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C4%83ile%C8%99ti), in 1987, two years before the fall of communism.

My childhood was happy, *very Balkan*, and marked by a permanent connection to the Internet.

Eventually, I've moved and currently live in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest).

I am happily married and the father of ~~a~~ two sweet baby girls. 

I have a bachelor's degree in *Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information* technology from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest (2009). I have a specialization in Computer Networks and Sofware Engineering.

I have played with math, computers, and programming languages since childhood. My parents were engineers, and they instilled in me a healthy curiosity for technology. My maternal grandfather and granduncle were math teachers, so they've played me into playing with me with numbers.

My first <sup>micro</sup>computer was one [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/). All the lucky Romanian kids from 90s had them:

I consider myself a generalist rather than a specialist. I know some stuff about low-level programming. I know stuff about building modern back-end systems. I've used many libraries and frameworks and reinvented the wheel several times.

Romanian is my native language, and I am fluent in English and French. I *almost speak* a fourth language; I will put it here once I become fluent.

#### `The blog`

I blog because I genuinely like programming and math.
