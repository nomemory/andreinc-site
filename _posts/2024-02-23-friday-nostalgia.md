While exploring the vast chambers of GitHub, I stumbled upon an [old repository](https://github.com/sergiou87/open-supaplex/) tucked away in a forgotten corner of the internet. An untimely wave of nostalgia engulfed me like a warm embrace from a (moderately) distant past. Faded memories worn with time transported me back to the carefree days of my childhood, a time filled with innocence, laughter, and all the frustration associated with playing [Supaplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supaplex) (on an old computer running DOS).

With a rush of adrenaline, I made the daring decision to clone the repository and build that game of *torture*. And it worked. It's called `./opensuplaplex` now.
