2023 was not a *prime* year. It was divisible by 7 and 17 and by a rollercoaster, but I've managed to survive it.

The *newest* family member started walking and talking, which is/was delightful. My second *newest* family member started to pose simple questions requiring complicated answers, which is always challenging. 

Software Engineering-wise, I am not precisely a *Professional* Software Engineer anymore since I switched to management years ago. But for reasons I am too afraid to admit, I still practice a technical hobby called *Recreational Programming*<sup>1</sup>. This means that I program for fun in my limited spare time (a few hours a week); it makes me feel nostalgic for the years when programming was not a job.

In 2023, I didn't achieve much and blogged little, but I did a few things I am proud of:

* I've finished and published an article I drafted and archived long ago called [*Demystifying bitwise_ operations in C*]({{site.url}}/2023/02/01/demystifying-bitwise-ops). Unexpectedly, It became pretty popular and got to the [first page of hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35010447), which is always lovely, but not a purpose in itself. I also had to pay 50$ to Netlify because of the traffic it created: I've forgot to compress the pictures and diagrams. Lesson learned. 
* I've curated and solved a list of [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) (or leetcode-like) coding challenges. I haven't yet published this list (it sits in an excel file), and I am not sure I will even publish it, because I don't think it's that useful for anyone other than me. Solving lots of exercises consistently through 2023 helped me improve my programming self-esteem. I've also recapped concepts I haven't touched in years (e.g., [tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), [heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)), [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking), and [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)). I highly recommend you do the same, even if you don't plan to interview at MAANG or similar. My list of exercises was built around [this roadmap](https://neetcode.io), so check that site if you don't already know about it.
* I've finished reading this (free?!) book: [*THE NATURE OF CODE*](https://natureofcode.com/) by Daniel Shiffman. I had fun playing with graphics, vectors, forces and (the forces of) nature. In the *process* I haven't learned "pure" [*Processing*](https://processing.org/), but I am now comfortable writing [p5js](https://p5js.org/) javascript code. I plan to publish some of my *modest* creations (2d and 3d) shortly.
* I've watched (the pen & paper way) two online calculus courses as my knowledge of the subject began fading away. I also discovered two tools I wish were available when I was still in school: [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and [symbolab](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). They are so helpful. There's no excuse for being terrible at math nowadays, except for lousy teachers, but you have YouTube to fix that. 
* I found myself lost (again) in the rabbit hole called [*Fourier Analysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis). The last time I got caught there was in Uni, but out of desperation to pass exams, I lost myself in grinding math without understanding the subject at a deeper level. I still don't **fully** get it, but at least I can *Fourier my way out of it* with a [low pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter). 
* I've switched from MAC to Linux at home and am amazed at how things have improved since 2012, when I last used Linux Mint. Everything works smoothly, and even if things are not as polished, I feel I'm in complete control of my *computational* life. 
* I returned to using an RSS reader to get to valuable content hidden in the contemporary web's noise.
* I have shown interest in AI and LLMs for work-related tasks (outside the area of creative programming). I also dabbled into cloud technologies, but that's not something I can develop on my blog. 

From a *cultural* perspective, 2023 was thin. I haven't read much, or seen impactful movies (with a few notable exceptions):

* I was gifted the [Seven Black Books of Carl Gustav Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Books_(Jung)). Footnotes were essential for me to understand what the author had to say or what the editors thought they understood. Seeing how gifted people perceive and approach the miracle of existence is always interesting. In his quest for [knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h-xI6wrHf9w), Jung comes up with unique insights. I wish his journals were less heavy on unfamiliar (to myself) symbolism and less open to interpretations. I did find [this YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HumbleUMedia) explaining quite a lot. All in all, I am conflicted: on the one hand, I'm not too fond of mysticism; on the other, I am attracted to it like a [*moth into flame*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tdKl-gTpZg). 

Music-wise, in 2023, I experimented with different genres I hadn't touched before. I am more of a prog-rock guy, but 2023 was the year of alternative rock, punk, and the *aesthetics of the 80s*. My favorite tracks of 2023 (as reported by Spotify are):

<sup>1</sup>I've first heard about *Recreational Programming* by watching [@tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/tsoding), and it made sense.
