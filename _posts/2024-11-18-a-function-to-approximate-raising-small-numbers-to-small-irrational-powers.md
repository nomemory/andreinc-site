## How it started

This story began, unexpectedly, on Facebook in a math-focused group. A teacher asked the group to determine the value of: $$\lfloor 3^{\sqrt{3}}\rfloor$$ without using a calculator. 

Naturally, the challenge was to prove whether $$\lfloor 3^{\sqrt{3}}\rfloor=6$$ or $$\lfloor 3^{\sqrt{3}}\rfloor=7$$ (my intuition leaned toward 7).

Eventually, the most convincing solution—proposed by Mihai Cris—was accepted by the group:

<p><div class="mp">
\[
3^{7}>2^{10} \Rightarrow 3^{7}*3^{10}>2^{10}*3^{10} \Rightarrow 3^{17} > 6^{10} \Rightarrow 3^{\frac{17}{10}}>6 \Rightarrow 3^{1.7} > 6
\]
</div></p>

And on the other end:

<p><div class="mp">\[
    3^7=2187<2401=7^4 \Rightarrow 3^{7/4} < 7 \Rightarrow 3^{1.75}<7
\]</div></p>

Since $$\sqrt{3}\approx 1.73 \Rightarrow \lfloor 3^{\sqrt{3}}\rfloor=6$$.

**Later edit:**

After sharing the post on [reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gu95wu/a_joke_in_approximating_numbers_raised_to/), user `/u/JiminP` proposed an alternative method:

<p>
<div class="mp">
\[
6^3=2^3*3^3<3^2*3^3=3^5 \Rightarrow 6 < 3^{\frac{5}{3}}=3^{\sqrt{\frac{25}{9}}}<3^{\sqrt{\frac{27}{9}}}<3^{\sqrt{3}}
\]
</div>
</p>

Simultaneously:


<p><div class="mp">\[
    48<49 \Rightarrow 3*2^4 < 7^2 
    \]
    \[
        3^7<256*3^2=2^8*3^2<7^4 \Rightarrow 7^4 > 3^{\frac{7}{4}}=3^{\sqrt{\frac{49}{16}}} > 3^{\sqrt{\frac{48}{16}}} > 3^{\sqrt{3}}
\]</div></p>

Which method is better? That’s [left to the reader](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/20084/is-using-the-phrase-is-left-as-an-exercise-for-the-reader-considered-good).

## The new problem

That problem was charming—but it sparked a bigger question:  
Could we approximate small numbers raised to irrational powers without using calculators, logs, or radicals—just **addition** and **multiplication**?

This was more of a joke than a serious challenge, so here’s my final formula (if you don’t want to read the rest):

<p>
<div class="mp">
\[
a^{\sqrt{c}} \approx \frac{-120-60[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]-12[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{2}-[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{3}}{-120+60[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]-12[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{2}+[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{3}}
\]
</div>
</p>

(... as long as $$\frac{1}{2} < \ln a * \sqrt{c} < 3$$)

## The first attempt

The *[Logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm)* and the *[Exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function)* functions came to the rescue.

1. We start by writing $$3^{\sqrt{3}}=(e^{\ln 3})^{\sqrt{3}}=e^{\sqrt{3}\ln 3}$$. We know this is true because $$3=e^{\ln 3}=3^{\ln e}=3$$.
2. We then use the [Taylor Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) expansion of $$e^x=1+\frac{x^1}{1!}+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\dots$$ .
3. Therefore,  approximating $$3^{\sqrt{3}}$$ becomes a matter of computing: $$1+\frac{(\sqrt{3}\ln 3)^1}{1!}+\frac{(\sqrt{3}\ln 3)^2}{2!}+\frac{(\sqrt{3}\ln 3)^3}{3!}+\frac{(\sqrt{3}\ln 3)^4}{4!}+\dots$$.

To get even closer to the actual result, I computed the first 8 terms of the series expansion (and no, it wasn't by hand, as I've used [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) do it for me):

```
1+Sqrt[3]*Ln[3]+(Sqrt[3]*Ln[3])^2/2!+(Sqrt[3]*Ln[3])^3/3!+(Sqrt[3]*Ln[3])^4/4!+(Sqrt[3]*Ln[3])^5/5!+(Sqrt[3]*Ln[3])^6/6!+(Sqrt[3]*Ln[3])^7/7!+(Sqrt[3]*Ln[3])^8/8!
```

## The eureka!

At this point I had a few *flashbacks* from my school days, and two ideas resurfaced.

Firstly, there was something called *[Small Angle Approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_approximation)*, that happen when the angle is, as you would expect, (very) very small:

<p><div class="mp">\[
\sin(x) \approx x \\
\cos(x) \approx 1-\frac{x^2}{2} \\
\tan(x) \approx x
\]</div></p>

So I've wondered if there isn't something similar for $$e^x, \ln x$$ and $$\sqrt{x}$$, anything that works for small numbers.

Secondly, I remember watching a few months ago a video from [Michael Penn](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath), about something called *Padé  Approximations*: [Pade Approximation -- unfortunately missed in most Caclulus courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3PukSgFWRc). It was a subject worth exploring.


## Pade approximations are "smooth"

So, without going into too much details, a Padé approximation is a rational function (the ratio of two polynomials) used to represent a given function. The smart idea behind this technique is to distribute the *control points* of a polynomial between the denominator and the numerator of the rational function. 

A Padé approximation of order `[m/n]` for a function $$f(x)$$ is expressed as:

<p><div class="mp">\[
    f(x) \approx P_{[m,n]}(x)=\frac{a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\dots+a_mx^m}{1+b_1x+b_2x^2+\dots+b_nx^n}
\]</div></p>

Compared to *Taylor Series*, Padé seem to handle exponential behaviors and discontinuities better, plus in a lot of cases it converges faster.

Needless to say, I was curious how well those approximations actually work, so I've computed the Padé aproximation of order `[1/1]`, $$P_{[1/1]}(x)$$ for $$e^x$$. (For in depth *tutorial* follow the Professor's Penn *tutorial*, linked above).

<p><div class="mp">\[
    P_{[1/1]}(x)=\frac{a_0+a_1x}{b_1x+1}
\]</div></p>

To find $$a_0, a_1, b_1$$ we need to solve the following system of equations:

<p><div class="mp">\[
\begin{cases}
e^0=P(0)=a_0=1 \\
e^0=P'(0)=a_1-b_1=1 \\
e^0=P''(0)=2b_1(b_1-a_1)=1 \\
\end{cases}
\]</div></p>

After solving this, we will get $$P_{[1/1]}=\frac{2+x}{2-x}$$.

We can already see that the $$P_{[1/1]}$$ follows nicely $$e^x$$ for the numbers around $$0$$.

$$P_{[2/2]}=\frac{x^2+6x+12}{x^2-6x+12}$$ is even better at approximating $$e^x$$, at least up to a certain point.

![img]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2024-12-12-a-function-to-approximate-raising-small-numbers-to-small-irrational-powers/padeex22.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

So, in a way, $$e^x \approx \frac{x^2+6x+12}{x^2-6x+12}$$ is true for small numbers, just like $$\sin(x) \approx x$$ is true for small angles.

Or, even better, $$e^x \approx \frac{-120-60x-12x^{2}-x^{3}}{-120+60x-12x^{2}+x^{3}}$$ is true for small small numbers, just like $$\sin(x) \approx x$$ is true for small angles.

And it's get better, for the $$\ln x$$ function the equivalent `[2/2]` Padé approximation is: $$\frac{3(x-1)(x+1)}{x^{2}+4x+1}$$. Notice how the approximation is bad if $$x < 0.5$$. For this we should find a better function.

And for $$\sqrt{x}$$ the `[2/2]` approximation will be $$\frac{5x^{2}+10x+1}{x^{2}+10x+5}$$.

## The "monster" function

Putting all together. 

1. To compute $$e^x$$ for $$x \in (0,4)$$, we use: $$\frac{-120-60x-12x^{2}-x^{3}}{-120+60x-12x^{2}+x^{3}}$$.
2. To compute $$\ln x$$ for $$x \in (0.5, 4)$$ we use: $$\frac{3(x-1)(x+1)}{x^{2}+4x+1}$$.
3. To compute $$\sqrt{x}$$ for $$x \in (0, 4)$$ we use: $$\frac{5x^{2}+10x+1}{x^{2}+10x+5}$$.

So for "small numbers" we can approximate $$a^b$$ using the following expression:

<p><div class="mp">\[
    a^b \approx \frac{-120-60[b*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]-12[b*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{2}-[b*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{3}}{-120+60[b*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]-12[b*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{2}+[b*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{3}}
\]</div></p>

Or we can compute:

<p><div class="mp">\[
a^{\sqrt{c}} \approx \frac{-120-60[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]-12[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{2}-[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{3}}{-120+60[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]-12[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{2}+[\frac{5c^{2}+10c+1}{c^{2}+10c+5}*\frac{3(a-1)(a+1)}{a^{2}+4a+1}]^{3}}
\]</div></p>

## Testing the "monster" function

Now, to test our marvelous approximation, let's compute $$2^{\sqrt{2}}$$:

1. We start approximating the logarithm: $$\ln 2=\frac{3(2-1)(2+1)}{2^2+8+1}=\frac{3*1*3}{4+8+1}=\frac{9}{13} \approx 0.69$$. 
2. We continue approximating the radical: $$\sqrt{2}=\frac{5*2^2+20+1}{4+20+5}=\frac{20+20+1}{29}=\frac{41}{29} \approx 1.41$$
3. We compute the product: $$0.69*1.41 \approx 0.97$$.
3. We actually compute the power: $$2^{\sqrt{2}}=e^{\sqrt{2}\ln 2} \approx e^{0.97}=\frac{-120-60*(0.97)-12*(0.97)^{2}-(0.97)^{3}}{-120+60*(0.97)-12*(0.97)^{2}+(0.97)^{3}} \approx 2.6612$$

The actual result should've been: $$2.6651$$. Not bad. 

Computing $$3^{\sqrt{3}}$$ with our function yields: $$6.58$$ instead of $$6.70$$. Not terrible.

## Final thoughts

* The monster function is clearly impractical—especially in the era of logic gates and floating-point math. But that wasn't the point.

* This post was just a fun excuse to explore Padé Approximations firsthand.

* I briefly considered extending this technique to Fourier series. While some research exists on "rationalizing" Fourier series to reduce Gibbs phenomena, Padé approximations lose periodicity, so it's a tricky compromise.
