This is exactly what it claims to be: a Spotify playlist featuring songs that dive headfirst into the strange, shiny, soul-crushing realities of life under the yoke of frivolous free markets. Capitalism has a soundtrack!

And really, what could be more capitalistic than paying a monthly subscription to listen to your favorite anti-capitalist anthems — without ads?

So plug in, subscribe, share, like, and enjoy the ride:

**1. Queen - I want it all**

I know this song is really about youthful exuberance—or the triumph of raw ambition and willpower—but to me, it sounds more like the anthem of a reckless trader maxing out leverage on a wildly volatile day in NatGas and Bitcoin. 

Or perhaps it's the soundtrack to someone pouring their life savings into sketchy "pharma" startups desperately hoping to be acquired, land a lucrative patent, or stumble upon the cure for male pattern baldness.

**2.Janis Joplin - Mercedes Benz**

> “Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a Mercedes Benz”

The subtle irony lies in the wording—she’s not asking God to give her a Mercedes, but to buy one. Even the divine, it seems, must bow to the market and make the purchase. God might gift you a Toyota, sure—but a Mercedes? That requires a proper transaction.

As a side note, this was the last song Janis Joplin ever recorded.

**3. The Black Angels - Currency**

> “Print and print the money that you spend,
spend and spend the money that you print then.”

I’m not entirely sure whether this song is about the abandonment of the gold standard, the entropic nature of inflation, or the societal decay brought on by relentless Quantitative Easing. Either way, the idea of printing money feels almost quaint now—these days, we just update numbers in a database.

**4. Alan Cumming, Cabaret Ensemble - Money**

> At the window...
Who′s there?
Hunger!
Ooh, hunger!
See how love flies out the door...
For
Money makes
The world...

In capitalism, they say money makes the world go round—but according to physicists, nothing moves until you observe it. That’s why I prefer not to think about my finances at all: it keeps me in a superposition of rich and poor.

**5. David Bowie - Dollar Days**

> Those oligarchs with foaming mouths phone now and then
> 
> Don't believe for just one second I'm forgetting you
> 
> I'm trying to
> 
> I'm dying to

This song might be more about facing death than critiquing capitalism (though the two aren’t exactly strangers), but there’s one lyric in particular—tight and unforgiving, almost Procrustean—that captures the way people bend and break under the pressure of the dollar. It’s a line that sticks with you. What "lyric" am I talking about?

**6. Pulp - Common People**

> 'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
> 
> Watching roaches climb the wall
> 
> If you called your dad he could stop it all

This is about the rich flirting with austerity as if it were an aesthetic—drinking cheap beer, eating fast, cheap, and borderline poisonous food, and dressing in carefully curated vintage outfits that mimic the look of a hobo—all while knowing they can walk away at any moment. They even hang around poor people with a kind of wide-eyed fascination, like anthropologists observing a foreign tribe. It’s not just comedic—it’s anthropological in a twisted, almost voyeuristic way.

**7. Ms. Lauryn Hill - Consumerism**

> Listen consumerism running through them like
>
> A tumor in 'em

What is your favourite *ism* of the day ? Reject *consumerism* is the correct answer.
